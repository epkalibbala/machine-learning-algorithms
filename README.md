**Machine Learning Algorithms Explained**

This repository contains implementations and explanations of various machine learning algorithms applied to the same dataset for comparative analysis. Each algorithm is implemented in Python using popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow. 

### Dataset
The dataset used in this repository is MAGIC Gamma Telescope. This dataset is used to predict which particles strike the telescope.

### Algorithms Covered
1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Decision Trees**
4. **Random Forest**
5. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
7. **Naive Bayes**
8. **K-Means Clustering**
9. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
10. **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**
11. **Neural Networks**

### Contents
- Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Python script, along with a Jupyter Notebook explaining the algorithm, its implementation, and its performance on the dataset.
- A comparative analysis is provided in a separate notebook to compare the performance of different algorithms on the same dataset.
- The dataset used is included in the repository or linked to from an external source.

### Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebooks to explore the implementations and explanations of each algorithm.
3. Run the scripts to train and evaluate the algorithms on the dataset.
4. Refer to the comparative analysis notebook for insights into the performance of different algorithms.
